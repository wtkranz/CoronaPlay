# CoronaPlay

Some simple minded data anlysis concerning the developing Covid19 pandemic.

You can have a look at the [Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/wtkranz/CoronaPlay/blob/master/coronaplay.ipynb) and even run it from there by clicking on the [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) icon.

### Disclaimer
I am not an epidemic or Covid19 expert and I haven't checked the data sources I am using. I simplify follow my curiosity and try to learn the Python [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) data analysis library.
